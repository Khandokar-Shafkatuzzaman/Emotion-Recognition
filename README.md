# Emotion-Recognition_CSE465
For years, scientists studying facial expressions have focused their research on six primary emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, and disgust.
We collected dataset from google and we will experiment our CNN model on those datasets. 
Example:
The AR Face Database, The Ohio State University
AT & T - The Database of Faces
The Basel Face Model (BFM)
Caltech Faces
Model Selection:
Basically we will use Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for building our model

Mode Training And Testing:

We took 80% data for training our model and for testing we will take 20% data.

We will trail our model with full dataset if we will manage proper resources to train our CNN model.


We will also use Computer Vision for real time frame capturing.

Tools we are using:

Python
Keras (backend tensorflow)
